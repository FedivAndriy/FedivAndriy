# Hi there, I'm Andrii! 👋

I'm a Computer Science student currently based in Slovakia, transitioning my focus from FrontEnd development to **Web3 Security, Smart Contracts, and the Solana ecosystem**. My goal is to become a high-level Web3 Auditor / Solana Developer. 🦀

### 🔭 What I'm currently working on
- Deep diving into **The Rust Programming Language** (currently mastering Structs, Enums, and memory management).
- Building foundational CLI tools, parsers, and emulating smart contract logic in Rust.
- Exploring the **Solana Account Model** and Web3 Security vulnerabilities.
